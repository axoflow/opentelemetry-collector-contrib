## Configuration
| Field       | Default   | Description                                |
|-------------|---------- |--------------------------------------------|
| `providers` | required  | List of providers that to be subscribed to |

## Troubleshooting

Component can not start, fails with "Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service."

In case of non-graceful shutdowns there could be orphaned trace sessions that have to be manually stopped.
Based on the types of the configured providers it's possible that even **one orphaned** session blocks the start up sequence of the ETW receiver.
[See the official documentation for details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing#types-of-providers)

Use the following command to list currently active tracing sessions:

```powershell
logman.exe query -ets
```

The name of the orphaned session follows this pattern: `ETWReceiverSession-etw/<name_of_the_receiver>`
Run the following command to stop and remove the session:

```powershell
logman.exe stop -ets ETWReceiverSession-etw/<name_of_the_receiver>
logman.exe delete -ets ETWReceiverSession-etw/<name_of_the_receiver>
```
